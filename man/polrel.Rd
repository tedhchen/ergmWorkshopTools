\description{
An undirected network where ties indicate the dyad is a politically relevant one. This means that the two countries are physically contiguous or at least one country is a major power. This network data is adapted from Gleditsch, Salehyan, and Schultz (2008). The network includes 189 states in the international system during the post-Cold War period (1989-1995) except Samoa. The row and column names are country codes from the Correlates of War project.
